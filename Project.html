About me 
</h1>
    <p>
        My love for coding began after i completed an introduction to python course with code first girls. 
        Growing up, i was never exposed to the idea of persuing a career in tech. 
        I was always intimidated with the idea of working with computers but once i started to practice coding regulalrly, 
        i was amazed with the idea of how a simple code can transform an idea into a reality.

<h1>
What i am learning
</h1>
<p>
    I am currently teaching myself how to code the following languages; Html, Css and React JS. 
    I must admit, juggling three jobs and learning code part time has been a pretty difficult task. 
    However, thanks to my mentor Luke, I have been able to find time to both practice and enhance my coding skills on freecodecamp. 
    It is a handy website and i would recommend it to anyone who is learning how to code for the first time. 
    <a href= "https://www.freecodecamp.org/" add target="_blank"> Click here to try it </a> It is completely FREE!
